# Box64Droid
# WARNING!!! Still in early stage, therefore there may be problems and shortcomings
Box64Droid is a script that automates the installation of a preconfigured rootfs with [Box86](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86), [Box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64), [Proton 8.0-2](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton), [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) and [vkd3d-proton](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton) installed. Project based on Box4Droid, original author is [Herick75](https://github.com/Herick75)

Project chat [available](https://t.me/box64droidchat) in Telegram, also there is a [site](https://Ilya114.github.io/Box64Droid/)

## Do I need root?

Box64Droid using proot to run rootfs, so no, root is not required, chroot also can use.

## How to install?  

First you need to install [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/download/v0.118.0/termux-app_v0.118.0+github-debug_arm64-v8a.apk) and [Termux-x11](https://github.com/Ilya114/Box64Droid/releases/download/beta/termux-x11.apk). After installing them, just copy and paste in Termux this command then when Box64Droid install: `curl -o install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kryptous/Box64Droid/main/scripts/install && chmod +x install && ./install`

If you have Mali, PowerVR or Adreno below 616 you can use rootfs with VirGL (Not stable and much games maybe not working): `curl -o install-virgl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kryptous/Box64Droid/main/scripts/install-virgl && chmod +x install-virgl && ./install-virgl`

If you have root, you can use chroot version instead of proot: `curl -o install-root https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kryptous/Box64Droid/main/scripts/install-root && chmod +x install-root && ./install-root`

## How to start Box + Wine?

After the installation is completed, type `start-box`, starting script will start Termux-X11 and show start menu.

You can also use Input Bridge, install 0.1.9 apk then just run app in Android and in Wine from start menu,

## System requirements 

- Adreno 616+ recommend (Another GPU's supporting but less games work)
- Android 12+ (proot version), Android 10+ (chroot version)
- 64-bit Android 
- You also need at ~5,0 GB (or ~3,3 for VirGL version) free for the installation to go without problems.

## How to configure?  

You can choose to use environment variables, there are 3 files, `dxvk.conf`, `Box8664.conf` and `DXVK_env.conf`. These files are created and found in the internal storage inside the Box64Droid folder right after the first run of Box86 or Box64.

The `Box8664.conf` file is for you to use the Box86 and Box64 environment variables, see all of them [here](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md#) and [here](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md). You can add as many variables as you like.

The `DXVK_env.conf` file is for you to use the environment variables referring to [DXVK_HUD](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk#hud), in addition to other settings.  

The `dxvk.conf` file is for you to use the environment variables referring to [dxvk](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/blob/master/dxvk.conf)(To use it, it is necessary to uncomment the line that exports your directory, this variable is found in `DXVK_env.conf`).

## Known issues

- Error when updating Termux packages. Clear Termux data will help.
- Android 12+ can kill Termux, you may get `[Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter]`, to fix run this command in adb shell: `adb shell "/system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647"`
- "Control" menu in Wine (in Proton 8.0-2 working fine) shows nothing. You can just open `control` using "Run"
- Box64Droid can exit after start. This is a TFM issue, no have idea why and how to fix. 
- Winetricks runs a long of time when Proton installed (proot)

And there are probably other issues, so feel free to open an issue.

## Instructionsl how to mount SD-card external HDD/SSD (chroot version)

If you want mount sdcard or external HDD (SSD), you need to add mountpoint. For sdcard go to /storage and see folder example `8D3E-2B7K`. For external drivers go to /mnt/media_rw and see folder like `C3G3H6B8A56212H7`. Type `nano $PREFIX/bin/start-box-root` and add mount command before `sudo chroot login ...` line: `sudo mount --bind /mnt/media_rw/drivename (or /storage/sdcardname) $ROOTFSPATH/needfolder`. You need to create `needfolder` yourself in ~/ubuntu folder by using `sudo mkdir foldername` 

## Things to note

Some issues/instabilities can happen when using Box86 and Box64 in proot environment, so it's not recommended to use Box86 and Box64 in proot as debug/testing environment, there are better options for that.
